//This thread sends out route update packets every ROUTEUPDATE_INTERVAL time
//The route update packet contains this node's distance vector.

//This thread handles incoming packets from the ON process.
//It receives packets from the ON process by calling overlay_recvpkt().
//If the packet is a SNP packet and the destination node is this node, forward the packet to the SRT process.
//If the packet is a SNP packet and the destination node is not this node, forward the packet to the next hop according to the routing table.
//If this packet is an Route Update packet, update the distance vector table and the routing table.

//This function stops the SNP process. 
//Tt closes all the connections and frees all the dynamically allocated memory.
//Tt is called when the SNP process receives a signal SIGINT.
void network_stop();

//This function opens a port on NETWORK_PORT and waits for the TCP connection from local SRT process.
//After the local SRT process is connected, this function keeps receiving sendseg_arg_ts which contains the segments and their destination node addresses from the SRT process. The received segments are then encapsulated into packets (one segment in one packet), and sent to the next hop using overlay_sendpkt. The next hop is retrieved from routing table.
//When a local SRT process is disconnected, this function waits for the next SRT process to connect.
